Horns a Plenty is a 6 piece brass ensemble that is 
re-defining what it is to be a brass quintet.  
We're all organic.  Nothing electric.  Who could 
ask for anything more?!
<p> 
We play ballroom dance music, swing, jazz, 
rhumba, cha-cha, Dixieland, classical 
music, fanfares, 19th century Americana, wedding 
favorites, love songs and ballads.  We have one foot 
in JS Bach and the other in Duke Ellington, with 
plenty of brass in between. We want to squeeze as 
much music as we can out of each and every note.
<P>
We perform music for private parties, swing dancing, 
wedding ceremonies and receptions, corporate events, 
restaurant evening entertainment, church services, 
public events or even an afternoon concert in the 
park. Imagine having a brass swing band for your 
own private house party or concert. How cool is that?! 
<P>
Because we perform without amplification, we can set 
up anywhere, indoors or out, and can moderate our sound 
level to suit most any kind of setting. And dig this... 
we know how to play soft! 
<P>
We play our music for the love of it and invite you, 
the audience, to join us in this journey of musical 
discovery.
