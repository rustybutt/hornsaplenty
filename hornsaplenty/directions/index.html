Welcome to Alameda!
<p>

First Presbyterian Church is four blocks up on your right, at the
intersection of Santa Clara and Chestnut.
<p>
<b><u>From HWY 880 headed north</u></b><BR>
Take the High Street exit. It will be a bit longer than what folks
in Alameda take, but it will be a lot easier!<p>
Bear right onto the frontage road and turn left onto High Street.<p>
Go under the freeway and up High Street, and across the High Street 
Bridge.<p>
Continue up High Street about 1/4 mile past the bridge and turn
right onto Santa Clara Avenue.  
<br>First Presbyterian will be just
a bit more than 1/2 mile up on your right.
