Jim Thorne is a drummer.   There are some who say that's all you 
need to say, but we say he's actually a very good drummer.  And
there's more!
<p>
Jim came to California from New York at an early age and has
been a serious musician pretty much all his life.  Older than
Tom Cruise and younger than Paul McCartney, Jim is better looking
than either of them, but he has had fewer wives.
<p>
At age 17, Jim started giving drum set lessons which he continues 
to do to this day.  At 18, he attended Chabot College and played 
in the Jazz Band with Tower of Power's Dave Garibaldi, and then
going on to play with the Cal State East Bay's Jazz Band and combos.   
<p>
Jim has played as a professional musician for years, playing thousands 
of gigs in many settings and genres.  He has performed with acts such 
as The Temptations, Pete Escovedo, John Handy, Madeleine Eastman, 
Tom Fogerty (of Creedence Clearwater Revival), Val Diamond 
(of Beach Blanket Babylon), The Tommy Dorsey Ghost Band and many others.
<p>
Currently, Jim performs with many local big bands, dance bands and 
the

which has recently released a new CD.
