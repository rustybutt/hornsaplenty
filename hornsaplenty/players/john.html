As a toddler, John&#39s child care provider was a whole family 
of musicians.  Clearly a bad influence that has stayed with to this day.
<p>
When John Kinney walked into his first band class, in 5th grade at Kate Kennedy
Grammar School, his band teacher, Frank Hansberry, took one look at him and said, 
"You can&#39t reach 7th position, but I&#39ll teach you anyway.  You&#39re 
playing trombone!"  His mother had high hopes for John, but he became
a musician anyway.
<p>
John and Russ first met in the 7th grade at James Lick Junior High,
 and have been friends and musical colleagues 
for half a century.  The president of the United States was a guy named
John Kennedy, Willie Mays patrolled the outfield for the San Francisco Giants,
a ride on Muni cost 15 cents, and if you wanted to subscribe to home delivery
of a newspaper, you had a choice of either the Chronicle or the Examiner in
the morning, or the News Call Bullitin in the afternoon.  Laughing Sal
still ruled in the Funhouse at Playland at the Beach and comic books cost
a dime.
<p>
John, a San Francisco native, currently plays with 
the

Golden Gate Park Band</a>,

Paul Price's Society Orchestra</a>, 
<a href="http://www.symphonyparnassus.org/" target="_blank">
Symphony Parnassus</a>,
 as well as Horns a Plenty. 
<p>
John studied with Lewis Van Haney at Indiana University and 
Edward Herman at the Juilliard School of Music,  where he 
received a Masters degree in trombone performance. 
<p>
When John returned to San Francisco, he spent several years 
in the Freeway Philharmonic performing in Napa, Vallejo, 
Modesto and Walnut Creek. Still driving for a living, John 
owned and managed a local delivery company, Matrix Express, 
from 1988 to 2002.
<p>
John lives in San Francisco, in the house he grew up in, 
just blocks away from James Lick Middle School.  He resides
there with his wife, Luisa, their son, Jack, and their two noisy dogs.
<p>
John now pursues a part-time career in music full-time.
