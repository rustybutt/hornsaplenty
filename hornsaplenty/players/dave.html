Dave was born into a musical family.  His father played clarinet and piano, and his 
mother loved to sing.  Dave's uncle, Leo Wright, was famous as a trumpeter
from the 1940&#39s to the 1980&#39s, in England, where his mother came from.
Dave started playing trumpet at the ripe old age of 8 years.  
He took up tenor saxophone at the age of 12 and is accomplished on reed
instruments as well as brass.
He was doomed to a life of music from the start.  Have some sympathy.
<p>
As a boy, Dave studied trumpet with John Owens, a veteran of the
Charlie Barnett and Red Norvo bands in the 40&#39s.   He studied
classical trumpet as a teen with Frank Haspiel and Gary Smith (2nd 
trumpet with the St. Louis Symphony at the time).  Dave minored
in music performance while at the University of Missouri at
St. Louis in the early 70&#39s.  He's been a member of the 
American Federation of Musicians since 1975.  Music is how he
makes his living.  
<p>
Yes. Dave is an anacronism.
<p>
Dave plays all musical styles professionally.  Classical, jazz,
big band, Dixieland, and even classic rock.  His biggest musical
influences include trumpeters Maynard Fergusen, Clark Terry, Doc Severinsen,
Sweets Edison, and on saxophone, players like Zoot Sims, Stan Getz, Paul Desmond, Johnny Hodges, 
Stanley Turrentine, Phil Woods, and Lew Tabackin.
<p>
Dave has worked with the Golden Gate & Oakland Municipal bands, Ron Borelli, 
John Moore, John Worley, Larry Souza, Frank Davis, Charlie McCarthy, 
Phil Shoptaugh, Dan Fava, Tim Acosta, Guido Fazio, Rex Allen... 
Dave played tenor sax with singer Terese Geneco at the Fillmore Jazz festival;
played lead trumpet with the Walt Tolleson Big Band; and has worked with
Michael Feinstein, Angie Dickonson and Kitty Carlisle.  He's played in 
bands backing such celebrities as Carol Channing, Jack Jones, Diahann Carrol, 
Debbie Reynolds, Johnny Rae, Frankie Lane & Kaye Starr.
This is what you'd expect from a veteran like
Dave with more than 3 decades of professional perfomrance.
<p>
You can also see Dave playing with the Bob Parlocha octet, the Oakland
Park Band and his own 17 piece big band in Alameda, as well as Horns a Plenty.
<p>
Dave lives in Alameda with his wife of 38 years, Judith, and their cat, Mongo.   
They have two daughters and three grandchildren.
