Pricing can be as little as $500 and is based upon:
<ul>
<li>how long you want us to play
<li>travel costs beyond 40 miles from San Francisco
<li>custom musical arrangements if they are needed
<li>sound equipment rental if it is needed
</ul>

<p>
Pricing for charitable fund raisers is open to 
negotiation. Don't ask us to play for free. You pay 
the caterer. You pay for the facilities you use. 
Someone can pay us as well. The very definition of 
"professional" is that you get paid for your services.  
We are sympathetic to the fact that you are trying
to raise money, not spend it.  That being said, we can 
work something out so that we both benefit.
<p>

Payment terms are that we require a 50% non-refundable 
deposit upon acceptance of the contract to commit the 
group for your event. The balance is to be paid at the 
event, prior to the performance. Payment may be made 
by check or in cash.  Payment for custom arrangements 
must be paid in full, when the contract is signed, and 
the commitment is first made.
