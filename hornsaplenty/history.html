Back in 2007, Horns a Plenty started out as a collection of players
reading through the standard brass quintet literature of Gabrielli canzonas 
and Johann Pezel baroque tower music.  The band leader, Russ Button,
had done a lot of that kind of playing back in his early college days
but had since played in and lead swing big bands, off and on, over the
next 30 years.
<p>
Like so many other musicians, Russ wanted to take his art form and
do something new with it.  With his big band sense of sound and
swing, he replaced the traditional French horn with a tenor trombone
and the tuba with a bass trombone.  French horn and tuba certainly
have their place in symphonic music, but Russ wanted to do many more
styles than the standard classical repertoire.  He's always loved
the rich sound of a trombone choir and felt that trombones had a
more focused sound and better attacks than French Horn and Tuba.
<p>
Early on, Eric Wayne joined the band.  At the first rehearsal he
showed up with his B-flat trumpet, C trumpet, cornet, flugelhorn,
D trumpet and his slide trumpet!  Russ was inspired to upgrade
both his cornet and flugelhorn and they remain a staple in the
ensemble to this day.
<p>
Over time, the music became more demanding and consequently,
the level of the players rose to meet the challenge.  Horns a 
Plenty long ago ceased to simply be a casual reading band.  All of the
players perform as professionals.
<p>
Dave Altschuler took over the trumpet seat that Eric vacated
when he moved on to pursue his 
<a href="http://digitalvictrola.com/" target="_blank">
Digital Victrola recording company.</a>  Dave plays saxophone
in addition to trumpet, cornet and flugelhorn, and is an accomplished
jazz soloist which brought many more possibilities to what might
be possible with Horns a Plenty.
<p>
By 2012, Horns a Plenty had amassed a sizeable collection of jazz
and swing arrangements, but was still missing the element that would
truly bring all of that alive.  That's when Jim Thorne joined the
group as their drummer.  A rhumba ain't really a rhumba without
drums.
<p>
Is Horns a Plenty a brass quintet?  Err... Sort of.
<p>
Is Horns a Plenty a brass band?  Uh... Sort of.
<p>
Is Horns a Plenty a swing band?  Ummm... Sort of.
<p>
There is no other brass quintet that we know of, which has the
instrumentation and covers quite the breadth of styles that does
Horns a Plenty.  What then, is Horns a Plenty?  We play music in a wide variety of
styles - classical, Park Band, ragtime, swing, jazz, love songs,
sad songs...  We've played for the Stanford Law School and
San Francisco Art Institue graduation ceremonies.  We've played 
for wedding ceremonies.  We've played for ballroom dancers and we've
played for belly dancers.
<p>
What kind of band would you call us?  Well you can call us whatever you 
want.  Just call us!
<P>
One special chapter in the Horns a Plenty story has been the
relationship they've developed with the Kipp-Bridge Elementary
School in Oakland, California.  In 2011, one of the players saw a notice that
Kipp-Bridge was looking for a brass band to come perform for their
6th grade music students, most of whom had never seen live, professional
level horn players before.
<p>
We went in and presented a program with a variety of musical styles
with the intent to show what it is to play in an ensemble.  We
emphasized how we listen to each other and play with dyanmics.
We used mutes and horns of various kinds, and most of all, we
showed them the simple joy of making music as friends.
<p>
Afterwards we found out that the Kipp-Bridge music program consisted
of 80 students playing recorder and 8 students in their band.  Why
only 8 students in the band?  Because they only had 8 instruments!
<p>
Horns a Plenty has donated 15 instruments - a mix of cornets, clarinets, 
trombones, a flute and a saxophone, all refurbished like new.  Now 
Kipp-Bridge has a real school band with more than 2 dozen enthusiastic
players.  When we visited Kipp-Bridge in 2013, their band performed
for us and we performed for them.
<p>
It is a well known fact that children who play musical instruments
are more engaged in school and do better in their academics.  The Horns
a Plenty players have played music all of their lives and this has
been our chance to give that love back to some of those who need
and appreciate it.
