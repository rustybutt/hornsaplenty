<h2>Brother Horn Bands From Around the World</h2>
</center>
<img src="imgs/alphorns_a_plenty450.jpg" nosave="" align="RIGHT">
<b><u>Alphorns a Plenty</u></b> was the first horn band to be
heard around the world.  In fact, they are heard
<i>all around the world</i> whenever they play, which 
is why they've been declared to be weapons of brass
destruction and a general menace to all mankind.
<p>
They have been known to
instigate avalanches in Tibet while playing in their 
native Switzerland as well as tsunami events all over 
the Pacific ocean.
</p><p>
What so many forget is that their
rendition of "Flight of the Bumble Bee" stopped the advance of an
entire German Panzer division in 1940, thus guaranteeing
Swiss independence during World War II.  Valor and victory in 
battle were nothing new for <b><u>Alphorns a Plenty</u></b>.  They originated
as a defense against the Mongol hordes that overran the Roman Empire
in the 5th century AD.  Over the centuries they recorded      
victories against the armies of Charlemagne, the Czars, Napoleon,
Kaiser Wilhelm, Little Bo Peep and the Singing Nuns of Saint Michael's.
</p><p>
All of Switzerland owes <b><u>Alphorns a Plenty</u></b> 
a debt of undying gratitude 
for their enduring freedom and national security.

The <b><u>Hickory Digeridoos a Plenty</u></b> band from Halls Creek,
Australia is considered a national treasure all through the country.
Their lilting harmonies put babies to sleep as well as sooth the
savage instincts of Koala bears everywhere.  Their rendition of
Beethovan's 9th Symphony is a favorite in pubs all through the land.  
<p>
Their magical melodies instill good will and harmnony to all 
who listen.  Even politicians of opposing parties in Parlement 
have been known to actually work together to solve problems
when <b><u>Hickory Digeridoos a Plenty</u></b> is playing in
the building elevators. 
</p><p>
Their fame is not limited to Australia either, as they have been
visited by Space Aliens from the 8th dimension.  They're a big 
horn favorite all through the multi-verse.  From Shangri-La to
the Greater Magellanic cloud,  <b><u>Hickory Digeridoos a Plenty</u></b> is
in great demand for weddings and parties, 
 as well as receptions for visiting heads of state.

Bandleader Max Profundus demonstrates the proper embochure for playing
the South Pacific conch shell.  As the music director of 
<b><u>Conchs a Plenty</u></b>, Max often leads the band
in ceremonies of virgin sacrifice, fast food restaurant
openings, policeman's balls, Rotary Club pancake breakfasts
 and royal coronations.  Their rendition of
Giant Steps must be heard to be believed.
<p>
Their music has been known to render hallucinogenic 
states of consciousness in listeners, which brings a 
whole new meaning to the phrase, "being conched out".
