Q. Why should I have a brass band for my event?
<p>
A. We play a wide variety of styles of music and will make
your event one to remember.  We play with love in our hearts
and it really comes out in the music.  Nobody remembers what
a DJ played at a wedding reception, but if there's a live
band, and one that sounds as rich as ours does, it becomes
something to remember.
<hr>
Q.  How loud is Horns a Plenty?
<p>
A.  Typically we use no amplification, and can moderate our sound level
easily to suit the occasion.  If you're having a dinner or garden party, 
we can play pleasureable listening music at any level you desire.  
<p>
If you want a powerful fanfare to announce the arrival of the bride,
we can do that too!

Q. We are <a href="wedding.html">planning our wedding reception</a>.  What concerns or issues should we be aware of in having your ensemble play for us?
<p>

A.  Click <a href="wedding.html">here</a> for what I have to suggest about wedding receptions.

Q.  How much space does the group need to play in?
<p>
A.  We sit with our music on stands, and because we have no amplification,
can easily fit into a space as small as 10 X 15 feet.
<hr>
Q.  Can you play dance music?
<p>
A.  We play many styles of music, including waltzes and swing tunes,
but we really aren't a dance band.  We have a number of songs that would
be suitable as the First Dance at a wedding reception and we certainly love
it when people dance to what we play.  But this isn't a dance band.
<hr>
Q.  There is a song that I want performed, but I don't see it on the play list. 
<p>
A. With a 4 week lead time, we can pretty much acquire any published 
arrangement, if it exists.  If a custom arrangement is required, we
can commission it, but the lead time for that is 12 weeks.
<hr>
Q.  My great aunt Mathilda does a wonderful rendition of "Melancholy Baby"...  
Can she sing with the group at the event? 
<p>
A.  We don't have an arrangement of "Meloncholy Baby", but if you
provide us with one, or are willing to commission an arrangement, then
your Aunt Mathilda is welcome to sing it.  For an additional fee, we can even bring a PA
system and a microphone for her to use.
