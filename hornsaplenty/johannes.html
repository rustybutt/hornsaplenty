Johannes and his  partner of 30 years live in a live/work loft space in Oakland.  They have a large industrial artist space where his partner work as a textile artist and painter.  They do what they can to survive and to keep reality at bay.  They have an amazing Blue Crown Conure (parrot) named Beanie, who they&#39ve had since chickhood and is now 8 years old.  She&#39s not caged, flies free and is a truly amazing creature. 
 They live an eclectic and varied existence, keeping life interesting and constantly challenging...  just the way they like it.
